=============

This is a modified version of the open-source game Pixel Dungeon, which 
is a traditional roguelike game with pixel-art graphics and simple interface.
This modification adds a tutorial to the game to help new players get started,
and we have also added a map editor/play custom map mode, to give
players the ability to modify their play experience.

The source code of this modification is available here:

The original game is available here:

In order to use the source code you will need to right click on the project in eclipse, 
choose build path then link source tab, then add a new source that targets the pdclasses
folder.
